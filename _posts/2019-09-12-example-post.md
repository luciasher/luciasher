You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

**GOOD MORNING!**

## My name is Lucia, but my nickname is Lurch. 

Here's a useless table:

| Siblings | Name | Age |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| 1 | Phoebe | 10 |


How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!
