**WELCOME!**

## Quick Facts About me!. 

- I am a firstyear. 
- I think I want to major in Art History but that is subject to change. 
- I have sewn quite a lot, but mostly machine sewing. I took sewing lessons from the ages of 10-14 and then I began making my own clothes and costume designing at school! I hope to continue costume designing at Williams. 
- I have absolutely no programming experience except for being a part of the robotics club as a 5th grader, which doesn't count.
- I hope to come away from this class with a better understanding of coding, and how to create a product that impliments electronics into wearable technology!
- One boring fact about me is that I have 3 kinds of asthma, yes I know, I am just that cool. 


How about a yummy crepe?
