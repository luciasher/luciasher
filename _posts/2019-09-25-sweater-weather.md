## Overview:
In my program you are able to input any temperature into it and find out what kind of sweater weather it it. I used a series of If statements, one If, five else ifs, and one final else. Each statement represents a series of numbers that qualifies a kind of sweater weather. For example in one case if you inputed a temp between 66 and 75 degrees, my code would run and tell you that "A cardigan will do." As seen below. I even used some quipy remarks once the temperatures became impossible to survive.

## Tip or Trick:
One tip I would give my past self is to make sure there are no additional spaces or commas after I have finished my text in my print f lines. This was a mistake I made over and over again, and was easy enought to debug but it was a pain.
