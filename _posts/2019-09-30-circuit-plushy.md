## Overview:
In created a plushy that lights up all three LEDs when the button is pressed and the switch is on, and lights 2 LEDS when the button is pressed and the switch is off. The plushy's machinery include a switch, button, battery, battery holder, conductive thread, and three LED lights. I first made a paper diagram, where I drew out how the circuit would work. Then I made a real life example using alligator clips to test my paper diagram. Finally, I sewed the conductive thread and the mechanical components onto the plushy. 

## Tip or Trick:
One tip I would give is to test the sections of circuit one little bit at a time, THis way you have fewer mistakes to fix earlier, and you wont end up with extra wires either.
