## Overview:
In this program I created two homemade switches which powered an led. One switch was made of conductive fabric, 
and the other was created with two patches of satin stitched conductive thread. 

## Tip or Trick:
One tip I would give would be to continuously look at the back of your fabric to make sure there are no knots or twists in the thread you are working on or the existing thread in the sampler.
