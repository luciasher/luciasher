## Overview:
In this program I created a loop that prints the LED colors, red, green, and or blue based on how many times you run the program. 

## Tip or Trick:
One tip I would give would be to run consistant programs and impliment fixes accoringly. So, try little different fixes to your established code when you are not sure of the solution to trouble-shoot.
