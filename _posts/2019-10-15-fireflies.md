## Overview:
In this program I created a three programs that each programmed led's to flash at different rates and times to mimic three types of fireflies. 

## Tip or Trick:
One tip I would give would be to make the code as simple as possible and keep checking as I go along to make sure the bits I have work. I would also say to consistantly test the code not only for bugs but to see what effect it has on the leds.
