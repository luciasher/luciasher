## Overview:
In this program I created a program that coded for three fireflies each with individual flash patterns. Each firefly pattern works at the same time as the others without inhibiting individual timing. 

## Tip or Trick:
One tip I would give would be to make sure all of your variables are very organized. Because there were so many variables from each of the fireflies it was important to stay on top of them all.
