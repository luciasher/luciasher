## Overview:
In this program I created a program that coded so that everytime I pressed the button a random color was generated from the RGB led on the board. 

## Tip or Trick:
One tip I would give would be to do this program in steps. I worked little by little to keep all my variables and states and everything under control and it made it so much easier.
