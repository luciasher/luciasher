## Overview:
For this project I created a program that buzzes the morse code for my name when the switch is off, and when the switch is on buzzes the morse code for SOS. 

## Tip or Trick:
One tip I would give would be to do this code in parts. Make sure that the morse code itself works before making the code more complicated. The morse is so intricate so this is key.
