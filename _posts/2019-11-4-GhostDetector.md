## Overview:
For this project I created a program that lit up the red LEDs on the arduino whenever the light and temperature sensors sensed it was cold and dark. This program simulates a ghost detector that senses an ethereal precense and turns on warning lights.

## Tip or Trick:
One tip I would give would be double and triple check the circuitry to make sure that all your connections are clear. This is a really frustrating mistake because it can make you go crazy over the slightest missed connection.
