## Description:
For this project I created a glove that plays notes C,D,E, and F when the fingerpad touches the corresponding pad on the palm. However, the piano will only play if the temperature in the indoors or outdoors is too cold. If a full scale is played a light will turn on, and the final note will play for 2 seconds to signify that a full scale has been played. 

## Motivation:
This glove is meant to allow someone to play a piano even when in the cold. For me personally I am in an accapella group and so during a cold outdoor concert we could find our notes very easily with this device. 

## Materials:
1 Piece of Red Felt
1 Piece of White felt
1 Lily Pad Arduino
1 Buzzer
1 Pink LED
1 Temperature Sensor
1 Strip of Conductive Fabric
1 Sharpie
Red and Pink Embroidery Floss
Conductive Thread

## Tip 1: Sewing
I found it very difficult to sew the conductive fabric onto the felt. I would suggest pinning the fabric down with lots of pins to keep it very secure and using a slightly larger needle to make sewing easier. 
## Tip 2: Circuitry
I would suggest organizing an order of when circuit sections to sew when. What I mean is to sketch out before you begin sewing the best way to sew the circuir without mixing up positives and negatives nad making sure your wires dont cross. 
## Tip 3: Coding
I would as usual suggest debugging the code section by section in different folders so that you can keep track of your progress and remember what you did that was correct.
