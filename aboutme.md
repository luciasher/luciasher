subtitle: Why I am taking this course!
---

I wanted to take a course in the science/math field, but I am not a stem gal, *so what did I do?*
I chose a course that combined something I **AM** comfortable with: sewing, with something I am **NOT** comfortable with: computer science. 
I have always loved the idea of coding and creation and this way I was able to do both together and use the stem I learn and apply it to wearable tech. Best of both worlds!
I hope that I can apply my knowledge of sewing and design and use it to create something awesome!
